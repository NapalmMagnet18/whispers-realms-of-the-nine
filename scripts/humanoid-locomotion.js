// look swings (the camera orbits a still body) until the look is more than turnInPlace degrees off
// the body, then it turns in place to where the look is: whole, feet with hips, ONE turn to one heading,

// standing body keeps its heading whatever the look does: no turn in place. 'camera' (an aim game:
// the body IS the head): it snaps to the view on every input, walking too; a smoothed head reads as
// input lag. The heading comes from the raw move axes rotated into the camera basis (the same
// rotation player.js gives velocity), so physics can never bend it; the smoothed yaw lives in this
// script's own scratch (gaitOf below), never read back off the entity (wire-quantized). The engine
// turns no body: this script is the yaw's one writer. It only animates a 3D model: on a

// worked example.
// The clips follow what the body DID, never what it was asked to do: this script stands BEFORE
// player.js in the body's behavior list (templates/player.js), so the velocity it reads is what the
// body moved last tick: a body pressed into a wall reads 0 and stands, whatever the keys and the

// This is your game's look: the whole-screen pass between the rendered world and the
// player's eyes. Out of the box it shows the world exactly as the engine renders it. If the
// world has emissive/glow content, the engine uses the bloom defaults below; plain worlds keep
// the bloom pass parked. Edit a number here and the game updates live.
// The pass is mode-agnostic: a game converted to 2D keeps this script working unchanged.
//
// The whole vocabulary: color grades, vignettes, film grain, retro pixelation, depth of
// field, scanlines: lives in the "looks" skill. Start by uncommenting a line below.

  // (a patchAtmosphere'd look param overrides the script's default). They're surfaced here so
  // the dials sit where you can reach them; the look itself never re-blooms.

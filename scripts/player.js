// controller to take it there (held until the next write: it slides, steps and grounds), forces
// push until null. Numbers live in lib/data/player.yml; gravity is the PLACE's
// (places/<p>/config.yaml gravity:), so a district that declares its own pulls on you the
// moment you step in. The body arrives dressed by the join: the template's model, else the card's
// avatar, and its own file carries Idle, Walk, Run, Sprint, Jump; any other clip is an address on a
// mixer channel (anim.sit = "cdn/clip-sit-loop.glb": →animations).

// The world's doorway (world.config.yaml engine.behaviors): onArrive fires for every way a player
// lands here (first join, rejoin, a portal in (player.arrival.kind says which)), and onLeave for
// every way they go. Where a player stands is the engine's to keep: a body is one durable row in the
// room: a refresh reconnects the same body, a return an hour later lands where you stood, facing
// the way you faced, so nothing here saves or restores a spot. A world where every visit
// starts fresh (an arena, a race) moves the player here: ctx.cross(player, 'main').
